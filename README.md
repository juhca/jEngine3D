# jEngine3D
3DGameEngine for Java (lwjgl dependent)

OpenSource version of the engine (ommited physics, etc.)
The engine is coded in java, with outside dependancies (specified in lib folder), employing OpenGL for shader coding.

Included are two Main Classes, one showcasing working with water, the other working with terrains.
It supports a mousePicker, GUI, import of OBJ models, skyBox, and more.

Lots of code left in the comments, as a gentle guidance of possibilities.

All are free to employ and modify for personal use.
